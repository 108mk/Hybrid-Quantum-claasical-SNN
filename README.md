# Hybrid-Quantum-claasical-SNN
 During my internship at TATA Elxsi, I worked on spiking neural network for neuromorphic object detection. I implemented a classical SNN on N-CARS dataset. I extended the work for a hybrid Quantum-classical SNN to see how useful Quantum VQE could be for object detection with noise augemented Neuromorphic daatset
